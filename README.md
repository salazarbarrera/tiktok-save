Firefox extension for downloading videos from TikTok

![Screenshot](/src/icons/Screenshot.png)

## DISCLAIMER
THIS DOESN'T REMOVE THE WATERMARK.

This extension only allows to download the videos as they are seen in the browser. It is, by the most part, just a CSS injection extension. 

This add-on is not associated with TikTok or Doujin in any way. Based on [image-save](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/instagram-save/) by [Jitendra Joshi](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11147266/).

## Usage
Right click over the videos and select 'Save Video As...' . What this extension does is to remove certain invisible DOM elements which cover the videos, and add certain functionality to control Firefox native media player with mouse clicks or taps.

## Usage
[Read Changelog.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Get yours!
