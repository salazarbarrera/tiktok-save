# tiktok-save
Firefox extension for downloading videos from TikTok. Based on image-save by Jitendra Joshi.

## DISCLAIMER
THIS DOESN'T REMOVE THE WATERMARK.

This extension only allows to download the videos as they are seen in the browser. It is, by the most part, just a CSS injection extension. 

This add-on is not associated with TikTok or Doujin in any way.

## Usage
Right click over the videos and select 'Save Video As...' . What this extension does is to remove certain invisible DOM elements which cover the videos, and add certain functionality to control Firefox native media player with mouse clicks or taps.

## Get yours!
